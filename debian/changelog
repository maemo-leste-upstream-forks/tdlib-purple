purple-telegram (20240112.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Initial release for testing
  * The debian/rules package could use improvements
  * The tdlib dir currently ends up in $HOME/.local/share/tdlib - this means
    that apparmor needs to be disabled for this to work currently, as it
    doesn't allow telepathy processes access to $HOME/.local/share/
